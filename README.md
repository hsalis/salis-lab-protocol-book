# Salis Lab Protocol Book

![](.gitbook/assets/protocol_book_cover.png)

This [Git Protocol Book](https://www.gitbook.com/) introduces skills in computational biology and experimental microbiology required in the Salis Lab. First, you'll be introduced to popular bioinformatics tools, our best practices for software development, and a how-to-guide for using the DNA Compiler \(DNAc\). With these tools, you'll be well equipped to _design_ and _study_ synthetic genetic systems. Secondly, you'll be introduced to conceptual workflows, basic lab techniques, and experimental protocols to _build_ and _test_ your designed genetic systems. Continue reading [here](contents.md) for more details on the contents of this protocol book and how to get started in the Salis lab.
